Human Activity Recognition Using Deep Neural Network

Currently use 2d Neural Network to classify the Human Activities

Do the following 
 1. from UCF 101 on my server select the classes you feel are relevant
 2. copy the folders containing these videos into a new folder and edit VIDEO_PATH in config to this folder
 3. run extract.py to extract random frames from the videos
 4. run fit.py to make a model from the images
 

TODO:
 - [ ] Actually run this thing
 - [ ] Add 3D CNN god knows how (plz find good link)
